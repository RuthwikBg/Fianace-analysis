# Fianace-analysis
This repository provides a Python script that can be used to parse the financial statements 

## Overview

The script also writes the sentences in the notes section to a docx file for each company.

## Output
The script outputs two types of files:

An Excel file for each company containing the extracted financial information.
A docx file for each company containing the sentences in the notes section of the financial statements.
